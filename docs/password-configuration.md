# User Password Configuration

This document describes the methods for configuring passwords when creating a ClickHouse User resource.

## Overview

When creating a User resource, you must choose ONE of these mutually exclusive password configuration methods:

1. **Auto-generate Password** (`autoGeneratePassword: true`)
2. **Bring Your Own Password** (`passwordSecretRef`)

`writeConnectionSecretToRef` is required for Method 1 (the controller writes the generated password there).
For Method 2 it is not needed: the hash is written back to `passwordSecretRef` itself.

See [Validation](#validation) for error cases.

## Method 1: Auto-generate Password

Let the provider generate a secure random password.

### How it works

1. Set `autoGeneratePassword: true`.
2. Controller generates a cryptographically secure random password.
3. Writes to the secret referenced by `writeConnectionSecretToRef`:
   - `password`: plaintext password.
   - `hash`: SHA256 hash.
4. Auto-sets `passwordSha256HashSecretRef` pointing to that secret.
5. Idempotent: if `hash` already exists in the secret, skips generation.
  **The hash is not recomputed or compared against the plaintext**; existence alone is the signal
  that the controller has already run.

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: clickhousedbops.crossplane.io/v1alpha1
kind: User
metadata:
  name: myuser
  namespace: default
spec:
  forProvider:
    name: myuser
    autoGeneratePassword: true
  writeConnectionSecretToRef:
    name: myuser-credentials
    namespace: default
  providerConfigRef:
    name: default
```

Resulting `myuser-credentials` secret:

```yaml
data:
  password: <base64-plaintext>
  hash: <base64-sha256-hash>
```

### Password rotation

Deleting the `writeConnectionSecretToRef` secret triggers rotation: the controller detects the secret is gone,
generates a new password, recreates the secret, and updates ClickHouse.
Deleting and recreating the User resource has the same effect.

> **Warning:** deleting the secret causes a new password to be generated.
> Any application using the old `password` key will break until updated.

## Method 2: Bring Your Own Password

Point to a user-owned secret containing a plaintext password.
The controller reads the plaintext, computes the hash, and writes the hash back to the **same secret**.
No `writeConnectionSecretToRef` needed.

### How it works

1. Create a secret with the plaintext password under the key of your choice.
2. Set `passwordSecretRef` pointing to that secret (`name`, `key`, optional `namespace`).
3. Controller reads the plaintext.
4. Computes SHA256 hash.
5. Writes hash back to the same secret under key `hash`.
6. Auto-sets `passwordSha256HashSecretRef` pointing to that secret.
7. Supports password rotation - see below.

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-password          # user-owned, NOT managed by Crossplane
  namespace: default
type: Opaque
stringData:
  password: "my-secure-password-123"
---
apiVersion: clickhousedbops.crossplane.io/v1alpha1
kind: User
metadata:
  name: myuser
  namespace: default
spec:
  forProvider:
    name: myuser
    passwordSecretRef:
      name: my-password
      key: password
      # namespace is optional, defaults to resource namespace
  providerConfigRef:
    name: default
```

After reconciliation, the same secret also contains `hash`:

```yaml
data:
  password: bXktc2VjdXJlLXBhc3N3b3JkLTEyMw==
  hash: <b64encoded-computed-sha256-hash>
```

### Secret ownership

`my-password` is user-owned - Crossplane does not manage it and will **not** delete it when the User resource is deleted.
This is the key advantage over Method 1.

### Password rotation

Update the plaintext in `passwordSecretRef`. On the next reconcile the controller:

1. Reads the new plaintext.
2. Computes SHA256 and compares to the existing `hash` in the same secret.
3. Detects mismatch → writes new hash.
4. Terraform provider sees the hash change → updates the ClickHouse user password.

```bash
kubectl patch secret my-password -p '{"stringData":{"password":"new-password"}}'
```

> **Note:** Password changes in ClickHouse are not immediate.
> This provider's controller only watches the User managed resource itself, it does not watch `passwordSecretRef`
> for changes. Reconciliation is poll-based (default: 1 minute), so the ClickHouse user password will be updated
> on the next poll cycle after the secret is updated.

### Edge cases

#### Deleting the User resource while keeping `passwordSecretRef`

The secret is user-owned - Crossplane does not manage it and will not delete it.
Safe to delete and recreate the User resource.

#### Deleting `passwordSecretRef` while keeping the User resource

- Controller cannot read the plaintext → reconcile errors
- `passwordSha256HashSecretRef` points to the now-deleted secret → Terraform provider errors
- ClickHouse user password is not changed
- **Recovery:** restore the secret with the plaintext.
  Controller recomputes and writes the hash on the next reconcile

#### Deleting only the `hash` key from `passwordSecretRef`

Hash missing → mismatch → hash rewritten on next reconcile. Reconciliation continues normally.

#### Reusing an existing `passwordSecretRef` for a new User resource

The controller recomputes the hash from the current plaintext and compares to any existing `hash`:

- Match → no write, reconciliation continues using the existing password
- Mismatch → new hash written, ClickHouse user updated to match current plaintext

## Method 3: Reference Hash Secret directly

If you have a pre-computed SHA256 hash and don't want to store plaintext in the cluster at all,
set `passwordSha256HashSecretRef` manually. This bypasses both methods above.

```yaml
spec:
  forProvider:
    name: myuser
    passwordSha256HashSecretRef:
      name: my-hash-secret
      key: hash
```

> `passwordSha256HashSecretRef` is an internal field auto-set by Methods 1 and 2.
> Only set it manually for this use case.

## Validation

The validator enforces:
- `autoGeneratePassword` and `passwordSecretRef` are mutually exclusive.
- At least one of `autoGeneratePassword`, `passwordSecretRef`, or `passwordSha256HashSecretRef` must be set.

### Invalid: both set

```yaml
# ❌ INVALID
spec:
  forProvider:
    autoGeneratePassword: true
    passwordSecretRef:
      name: my-password
      key: password
```

Error:

```
autoGeneratePassword and passwordSecretRef are mutually exclusive - only one may be set.
```

### Invalid: neither set

```yaml
# ❌ INVALID
spec:
  forProvider:
    name: myuser
```

Error:

```
one of autoGeneratePassword or passwordSecretRef must be set.
```

## Security Considerations

- **Method 1 (auto-generate):** plaintext written to `writeConnectionSecretToRef`.
  Enable encryption at rest and restrict Secret access via RBAC.
- **Method 2 (BYOP):** plaintext and hash both stay in the user-owned `passwordSecretRef`.
  `writeConnectionSecretToRef` is not used.
- **Method 3 (hash-only):** no plaintext in cluster at all.
- All methods: the Terraform provider only ever sees the SHA256 hash, never the plaintext.
